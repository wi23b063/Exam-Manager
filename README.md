# Exam-Manager

## Objective
The goal of this project is to create a tool that helps teachers organize exam questions and automatically generate exams.

## Description
Teachers often build exams by reusing and modifying old questions or adding new ones. This process can be time-consuming, especially for large courses that need multiple exam versions.

This tool makes that process easier by:
- Storing exam questions in a database
- Organizing questions into categories
- Allowing teachers to set how many questions to include from each category
- Randomly generating exams based on those settings
- Providing a simple interface to review and swap individual questions

## Main Features
- Database of categorized exam questions  
- Random exam generation  
- Customizable exam settings  
- Easy-to-use graphical interface
